# Wordle-Solver
Wordle-Solver is a program meant to aid in the solving of the daily Wordle Puzzle! 
As of now the program runs in the terminal, but may eventually support a GUI 
implementation. As the user makes guesses in the Wordle Puzzle, they enter their
guesses and the letter validities of each guess to the program. The program then
determines the next best guess as well as all possible guesses the user can make
based on the remaining letters in the Wordle. The implementation is not perfect,
but is fun to use and makes solving the daily Wordle that much easier!
